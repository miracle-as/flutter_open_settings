this plugin currently support jumping to WiFi, Mobile Data, Bluetooth ,Location, App Setting And Notification setting.<br/> 
Other setting path will be added soon.<br/>
<br/>

### For iOS:<br/>
this plugin only opens the app setting screen `Settings` application, as using url schemes to open inner setting path is a violation of Apple's regulations.
